# AMZ Smile

AMZ Smile is a chrome extension created to redirect browsing from Amazon to their Smile program, which results in 5% of each purchase being donated to a charity of the user's choice.

## User Privacy
AMZ Smile does not log or store ANY information from users. The only data it ever touches is the state of the on/off switch. This extension is not intended to generate a profit of any kind, just to get a little less money going to Mr. Bezos and a little more to charitable organizations.
